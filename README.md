# EDA-Practices
This repository is a collection of projects I worked on while learning and practicing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with Python. Each file reflects a different stage in my learning journey, where I explored various datasets and applied a range of analysis techniques to better understand the data and extract meaningful insights.

To carry out the analyses, I used widely-used Python libraries such as pandas for data manipulation, numpy for numerical operations, and matplotlib, seaborn, and plotly for data visualization. These tools helped me uncover patterns, trends, and relationships within the data.

The datasets used in these projects come from a mix of sources. Some were downloaded from Kaggle, while others were obtained from the official website of the National Bureau of Statistics, Nepal. Depending on the dataset, I cleaned the data, handled missing values, explored distributions, and visualized key variables â€” all tailored to what was necessary for each specific case.

Overall, this repository showcases my hands-on practice with real-world data and my growing understanding of how to make data-driven observations using Python.
